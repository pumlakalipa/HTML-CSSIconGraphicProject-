      The number of employment in the United States economy dropped dramatically by the end of the 2020 fiscal year compared to previous years as the country battled with the COVID-19 pandemic. According to research conducted by the Urban Institute, 12% of volunteers who participated in the December 2020 Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey reported to not have had enough to eat, while one-fifth of renters reported being behind on their rent amid the pandemic. The institution projected a poverty rate of 7.7% for 2021. The projected poverty rate was much higher for Black non-Hispanic people, Hispanic people, non-Hispanic Asian American people and Pacific Islanders than for White, non-Hispanic people.
